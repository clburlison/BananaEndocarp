# BananaEndocarp
BananaEndocarp is a scripted GUI for interacting with MunkiWebAdmin2's API.

Designed to be light-weight, portable, easy to modify, and maintain. BananaEndocarp sticks with a minimalist approach to creating manifests and follows the same principles as blogged about here: https://groob.io/posts/manifest-guide/.

Manifest within munki don't need to be complicated. This tool helps **automate the process of creating a unique manifest for each device** because that process can be tedious. This tool makes no assumptions about what your `included_manifests` look like. That task is up to you to design and create.

The above demo will result in a manifest that looks like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>catalogs</key>
	<array>
		<string>production</string>
	</array>
	<key>display_name</key>
	<string>011-115-maccb</string>
	<key>included_manifests</key>
